# DORM
DORM is a shitty new alphabet I made in 2 hours somehow

### What does it do?
Something

### What's with the name?
It stands for DOOM README.

### Why did you make it?
Long story short: bean

### How does it work?
Every letter is replaced by `.X`, X being the position of the letter in ATLAS.TXT, well, that's how it's supposed to be, and the dot is to make the decoder be able to tell what is a letter.
For example, H is .1, E is .2, and I is .6
